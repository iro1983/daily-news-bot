   I've been wanting to leave my corporate job for a while now and do something more hands-on. My wife and I were on vacation last month playing mini golf with the kids, and I had this random thought - I wonder what it actually costs to own one of these places.   I started researching when I got home and went down a serious rabbit hole. Turns out mini golf course for sale pop up regularly, especially older mom-and-pop operations where the owners are retiring. The listings are all over the place though - some want $500k for a full setup with land, others are just selling the equipment and obstacles for way less.   The real eye-opener was learning about startup costs if you wanted to build from scratch. You're looking at easily $100k-300k depending on the size, and that's before you factor t...

                 Hey everyone,   For the past week, I’ve been working on a fun project on the side of a Bloomberg-style terminal for crypto traders and I wanted to share a quick demo video. At first, I started because I kept running into the same problem: crypto market data is all over the place. Things like indicators, charts, funding rates, news feeds, order book APIs, on-chain stats, and everything traders use to analyze the markets are all on their own sites, with their own APIs and data pipelines.   I kept switching between a bunch of tabs and scraping together data from different APIs, and I couldn’t find one platform that really pulled everything together in a simple way. So I decided to try building something that puts all of that in one place, on one single interactive interface. ...
