I’m feeling stuck in my job inbetween mortgage payments etc etc and dreaming of owning a business since i was 15 (I’m 27 now) and I feel like time is passing. I tried couple of online things like the classic dropshipping etc made some small amounts but that was it, life took over and now I’m feeling really lost. My question to you is: How did you start your business? How did you come up with the idea for the business? I know that If you are looking for ideas on reddit, you probably shouldn’t start a business. What was your lightbulb moment, where you said “yeah i can do that”? Should I wait until that moment comes to me? Can everything be turned into a business? Do I really have to be p...

   We spent hours debating whether a feature (and we have many to share!) should be in this beta sprint or wait for the next. Users wanted one thing. We thought another. Every day felt like starting over. Until we realised ONE THING that WORLD CLASS developers actually do differently.    They ship before it’s perfect. Not blindly, not sloppily; but enough to test, learn and adjust in real time.    Coding, testing, shipping. Reset. Re-plan. Re-align.    It still feels messy, but now every decision generated feedback.    Each tweak, each user insight, each small win pushed momentum forward instead of stalling it.    Motivation gets us started, but momentum comes from making a decision, shipping it and using the result to guide the next decision.    If we felt like we were going back one circ...

    trigger warning - there's mental health issues talked about here.    A year ago, I raised money from VCs.   I'd built a few SaaS businesses before, most of them failed, one I exited for enough to quit my job.   I thought raising from VC would be just be a 'scale up' from what I'd already done, but it was a completely different game.   I ended up taking the check as a solo-founder with no team, and started building + launching the first product.   I kept shipping, and being solo, I did everything (dev, marketing, support, etc)   But the weight of it ended up really crushing me.   I went through the worst depression of my life this year. I got diagnosed with Adult ADHD, which explained a lot but didn't make it easier. I almost ended my 8-year relationship with my partner because I was so...
