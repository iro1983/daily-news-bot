Some sites are super clean and easy to follow, then others make you click around forever just to figure out what they actually do.   What caught my attention is the huge gap in how they explain stuff and what features they show upfront.

It’s interesting seeing how each one handles things like forms, setup flow, or how they organize everything.

As my cousin and I were catching up (he lives across the country) we were discussing our futures and stuff. I am currently on my way to becoming a doctor, but I've always had this nagging feeling it might not be the right path for me. Instead I've been thinking of other career paths, and I told my cousin about this idea of mine. He affirmed my idea by stating that he had the same problem, along with his family and friends. I thought that was pretty cool, but maybe it's just an idea that could be solved with a big company. Then I went golfing with a friend and we were discussing the future and I brought up this idea again. My friend had the same problems, and ...

Every massive consumer social app succeeds not because of the tech but because of a specific psychological hook enabled by a specific feature.   If you look at the giants you can see the pattern.   Snapchat was the privacy enabled by the message that gets deleted. LinkedIn was the professional recognition enabled by the profile view. Instagram was the beauty enabled by the filter. There are stories about the founder going into bars and testing filters on people just to prove they could make a photo look nicer instantly.   But I feel like Instagram lost that.

   I kept seeing couples fight over &quot;why are you being distant?&quot; and &quot;why are you being annoying?&quot;   Most men don't realize cycle phases affect mood, energy, and needs.    So I built Intimigo with the guidence of my partner, an app that informs about cycle phases and tells partners:     When to plan date nights vs when to give space   What she might prefer today (connection vs quiet time)   Daily insights to match your approach     Intimigo is made for couples and designed for men specifically. 2 months testing with couples, zero arguments about timing since.   Looking for more beta testers and feedback. Anyone else building in the relationship/health space?
